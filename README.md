# 🚀 TypeScript Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my 15-day TypeScript-based Competitive Programming Practice repo.  
Each day contains 2–4 core problems, solved in both `.ts` and `.js` for learning and compatibility.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

### ▶️ Online (No Setup Needed)

- Visit: [Programiz TypeScript Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/typescript/online-compiler)
- Copy the contents from any `.ts` file and paste it there

---

### 💻 Locally via VS Code (Recommended)

> Make sure Node.js and TypeScript are installed globally.

#### 1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

```bash
tsc day1/day1.ts
node day1/day1.js
